    <h3>The Conceptual Model for DFPS</h3>
    <div class="w3-whole">
      <p class="w3-text-dark-grey">
        When a water well drilled into an aquifer is pumped, the well water level declines and groundwater
        moves into the well, lowering the water level in the aquifer adjacent to the well. This causes water further from the
        well to move toward the well, which in turn lowers the water level more. This creates what we
        call a cone of depression in the water levels around the well. If there is a stream nearby, the
        decline of groundwater level induces flow from the stream into the aquifer. A schematic of the situation
        is shown here.

      <ul>
        <li><p class="w3-text-dark-grey">The aquifer is of infinite extent, has an impermeable base,
          and the groundwater system is static before pumping starts.</p></li>
        <li><p class="w3-text-dark-grey">The stream fully penetrates the aquifer and has a constant stage
          (i.e., the head along the stream does not change in space or time).</p></li>
        <li><p class="w3-text-dark-grey">When pumping begins, water is removed from storage. Ultimately, a
          steady state is reached when there is no further change in aquifer storage and all the pumped
          water seeps into the aquifer from the stream.</p></li>
        <li><p class="w3-text-dark-grey">
          It is assumed that the flow of the stream is significantly larger
          than the pumping rate of the well. This means that when all the pumped water is replaced by
          inflow from the stream to the aquifer, the stage of the stream does not change.

    <h3>The Mathematical Model</h3>
    <p class="w3-text-dark-grey">
      The Theis equation is used to describe the water level decline, \( s \), in the aquifer at any distance, \( r \), from a well that pumps
      at a constant rate, \( Q \), at any time after pumping begins, \( t \). An image well is used to represent the stream boundary.
      Image well methodology is discussed in Section 11.2 of
      <a href="https://gw-project.org/books/an-introduction-to-hydraulic-testing-in-hydrogeology-basic-pumping-slug-and-packer-methods/">
        An Introduction to Hydraulic Testing in Hydrogeology</a>.
      It is assumed the pumping rate, \( Q \), is
      constant and the aquifer is homogeneous and isotropic (i.e., has the same properties at all locations
      and the properties are the same regardless of the direction of flow). The aquifer properties
      that determine the amount of drawdown are transmissivity, \( T \),
      and storativity, \( S \). \( T \) is the product of hydraulic conductivity, \( K \), and the thickness of the aquifer, \( b \).
      Hydraulic conductivity describes the ease with which water moves through the aquifer and is analogous to
      the electrical conductivity of an object for the flow of current. Storativity describes the amount of
      water the aquifer can store for a given change in water level. It is equivalent to capacitance in an
      electrical circuit that describes the amount of charge that can be stored for a given voltage change.
      There are many places to read about the Theis equation; one is Section 8.1 of the PDF that can be
      downloaded free-of-charge from the Groundwater Project here:
      <a href="https://gw-project.org/books/an-introduction-to-hydraulic-testing-in-hydrogeology-basic-pumping-slug-and-packer-methods/">
        An Introduction to Hydraulic Testing in Hydrogeology</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="w3-text-dark-grey">The Theis equation is solved as follows:</p>
    <div class="w3-container w3-center">
      <img src="img/Theis.png" alt="Theis equation" class="w3-image">
    </div>
    <p class="w3-text-dark-grey">
      The symbols are: \( s = \) drawdown, \( Q_w = \) pumping rate, \( t = \) time, \( T = \) transmissivity, \( S = \) storativity, and \( x,y,z \) are 3-D Cartesian
      coordinates. For DFPS, the equation is simplified to represent steady, one-dimensional flow in the x-direction. It is
      designed for confined conditions but can be applied to unconfined systems when the drawdown is small relative to
      the aquifer thickness (e.g., &lt;25%).

      The DFPS equations for calculating stream depletion are discussed in:

      Groundwater, v. 6, no. 2, p. 37–46,
