    <h3>The Conceptual Model for WTR</h3>
    <div class="w3-whole">
      <p class="w3-text-dark-grey">A classic example of a steady-state analytical model is recharge to a strip of 
        land between two fully penetrating bodies of water. 
        It simplifies flow in an unconfined aquifer by assuming the recharge is instantaneously and evenly 
        distributed vertically throughout the aquifer and flow is horizontal within the aquifer.</p>
      <ul>
      <li><p class="w3-text-dark-grey">The top boundary has steady, uniform recharge.</p></li>
      <li><p class="w3-text-dark-grey">The two vertical boundaries are constant head. The water levels can be any
        height, but it is useful to remember that they represent fully penetrating water bodies so should fall 
        within reasonable limits. The water level can be higher on the left or the right. If the water levels
        are very different and the distance between them is short, then the assumption of of essemtially 
        horizontal is not as reasonable. The further one deviates from the fundamental assumptions, the less
        accurate the model results.

      <li><p class="w3-text-dark-grey"></p>The bottom is a no-flow boundary.</p></li>

      <p class="w3-text-dark-grey">Given a value of recharge, hydraulic conductivity, head in each water body, and 
        the distance between the water bodies, the model describes steady, one-dimensional, flow in a 
        homogeneous porous material. Because the model is one-dimensional and steady state, it solves for: </p>
        <ul>
        <li><p class="w3-text-dark-grey">head at any distance, x, from the left boundary, and</p></li>

  <div class="w3-content"><h3>The Mathematical Model</h3>
    <p class="w3-text-dark-grey">The algebraic model presented here is founded on the the governing 
      partial differential equation for flow, based on Darcy's Law and Conservation of Mass. </p>

      <p>The symbols are: h=head, t=time, T=transmissivity, S=storativity, W=sources/sinks, and x,y,z are 3-D Cartesian 
        coordinates. For WTR the equation is simplified to represent steady, one-dimensional flow in the x direction. It approximates 
        unconfined conditions by ignoring the slope of the water table and assuming recharge is instantaneously distributed 
        vertically throughout the aquifer, and water flows horizontally to water bodies of constant level on each side 
        of the system.
    </p>
    <p class="w3-text-dark-grey">The WTR equations are developed by Fetter (2001) in section 4.14, titled
       "Steady Flow in an Unconfined Aquifer" of his Applied Hydrogeology book, Prentice Hall, 
       New Jersey, USA, 598 pages.</p>
       <p class="w3-text-dark-grey">The algebraic equations are shown here, where R is the Recharge rate, 
        K the hydraulic conductivity, L the length between water bodies (as shown in the image above).</p>

      <h3>General Information on Analytical Models</h3>
      <p class="w3-text-dark-grey">Analytical models describing groundwater water levels and flow are mathematical 
      models involving direct solution of the governing partial differential equations for flow for a specific aquifer 
      geometry and associated boundary conditions. Generally, analytical flow models are limited to representing 
      homogeneous materials in one or two dimensions using rectangular or radial coordinate systems.</p>
      Analytical models provide an exact, continuous, solution for head and/or flow as a function of space and, 
      in the case of transient models, time. A continuous solution is one that can calculate a value for any 
      location in space and time within the model domain (e.g., h at the location x=64.56 m after pumping a well 
      for 5 minutes and 33 seconds). This is a distinct difference from numerical models which calculate values 
      of head and flow at specific, predetermined, locations and times. When using a numerical model, the modeler 
      interpolates between the resulting values to obtain heads and flows at locations and times between the 
      calculated values. Numerical model values may be in error because the solution is iterative and did not 
      close to a small tolerance or due to truncation of values of substantially different magnitude during the 
      solution process. Given the precision and accuracy of analytical models, sometimes they are used to check 
      if a newly developed numerical groundwater code produces accurate results.</p>
      <p class="w3-text-dark-grey">However, analytical models are limited to homogenous media with 
        simple geometry and boundary conditions.</p>
